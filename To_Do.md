# To do :

## General : Find a way to lose less horizontal space.

## Clock :
Find better colors for the calendar.
## Pulseaudio :
Change Pavucontrol for an alternative who doesn't change the volume on it's own.

Disable the message about which output is used.

Pwcontrol seems to not have the bug of random audio changes, but still countains a bunch of bug.

### In head for Pulseaudio :
When clicking it will show 2 horizontal slider on top of each other with each one an icon for Mic / Output, the name of the used device will be sliding if it can't fully appear.

Maybe pipewire has better alternative.
